# Test Your Skills
This is one of my hobby project it is built using MEAN Stack. This project solves quiz publishing problem, you can publish quizzes, participants can take online quizzes and they will get score which is stored with their profile.

Do the following if you want to run the project.

1. Download the source code.
2. npm install
3. bower install
4. npm start

npm start will start a web server on port 3000, it needs mongo DB which you can change to point to Mongo Lab. If you dont want to install it locally.
